    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The 2024 NFL Draft was stacked with quarterback talent, and now, with their rookie seasons winding down, it’s time to see how the top prospects have performed. Forget the pre-draft hype; let’s talk real on-field results.  Did these young guns live up to expectations, or are some teams already regretting their picks?</p>
<p><strong>Caleb Williams: The B+ Project</strong></p>
<p>First up, we have Caleb Williams, the number one overall pick for the Chicago Bears.  It’s safe to say his rookie year has been a rollercoaster.  Despite the Bears undergoing major changes – firing their offensive coordinator <em>mid-season</em>, and then their head coach – Williams has shown flashes of brilliance.  He has a ton of potential, but it hasn’t been a perfect start.  He’s been sacked a league-high 58 times, a number that highlights both his struggles with holding the ball too long and issues with the offensive line. The Bears need to build around him, but is he a franchise quarterback in the making? A B+ seems fitting, with room to grow.</p>
<p><strong>Jayden Daniels: The Surprise A-Lister</strong></p>
<p>Next, let’s talk about Washington’s Jayden Daniels, who has been an absolute revelation. He’s not just playing well; he’s been <em>record-breaking</em>. With the highest completion percentage by a rookie in NFL history, Daniels is proving that he’s more than just potential. What’s impressive is his ability to throw the ball first, rather than looking to run, which is rare for a rookie QB. He’s got the accuracy, the athleticism, and the game smarts. Daniels isn’t just an A, he’s making a strong case for rookie of the year. The Commanders made the right choice!</p>
<p><strong>Drake Maye: A Minus With Potential</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we have Drake Maye of the New England Patriots. He’s a tricky one because he landed on a team that’s clearly rebuilding. Despite a lack of weapons around him, and having to rely on his legs a lot, Maye has shown real talent and is growing into the role. He has had some rough patches with turnovers, but he has demonstrated the ability to win games.  Considering the circumstances, a solid A- is a testament to his potential. He just needs better support.</p>
<p><strong>Bo Nix: The Game Manager on the Rise</strong></p>
<p>Finally, the most divisive of them all: Bo Nix of the Denver Broncos.  He’s not flashy, but he’s effective, and he’s helped the Broncos get back to winning football. Despite throwing a few interceptions, he has played with accuracy and has proven to be a key asset to the team.  His success is down to his ability to stick to the game plan, a skill that has made him a great fit for the Broncos, and they’re reaping the benefits. </p>
<p>The 2024 rookie QB class has been far from boring. Some have exceeded expectations while others still have some growing to do.  It’s a promising start for many of these young quarterbacks, and it will be fascinating to see how they progress. What are your thoughts on the rookie QBs?
