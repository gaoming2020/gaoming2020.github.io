    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Ever wondered where the concept of IQ tests came from? It’s a topic that often sparks debate, with many questioning their relevance and validity. But let’s take a step back and explore the origins of these tests, and I guarantee, you’ll be surprised.</p>
<p>In 1908, Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon developed what’s considered the first intelligence test. It wasn’t about assigning a numerical IQ score like we see today. Instead, it aimed to identify children who might need extra support in school by measuring their “mental age”. This test, known as the Binet-Simon scale, included a series of age-based tasks. For example, one-year-olds were asked to follow a light or sound, while three-year-olds had to repeat a sentence. It’s fascinating to see how basic these early tests were, including asking six-year-olds which of two faces they found prettier - a concept that seems incredibly subjective today. It wasn’t about scoring high; it was about understanding which kids might be struggling in the new French compulsory schooling system.</p>
<p>One of the key takeaways is that Binet and Simon developed this test for a specific purpose: to <em>help</em> children, not label them. They were actually reacting against the prevailing idea of sending struggling kids to psychiatric institutions. They believed that these children deserved remedial teaching and special support to catch up, not to be treated as fundamentally deficient. The test questions were designed to highlight gaps in development. For example, asking 10-year-olds what they would do if they missed a train was an attempt to gauge practical reasoning, not just raw intelligence.</p>
<p>However, the story takes a dark turn. This initial attempt to help students was unfortunately warped by later figures who hijacked the test, changing it and using it for eugenics and immigration control. Figures like Henry Goddard, took the Binet-Simon test and twisted its use to support their awful beliefs and forced sterilization in the US. Later, William Stern invented the calculation we now know as the IQ score: mental age divided by chronological age, multiplied by 100. The original intention was completely lost, and the focus shifted from support to ranking, and that is why, it is critical to understand the roots of IQ tests so that we don’t continue down a harmful path. We need to be wary about placing too much value on a score and should instead look at a person’s contributions, achievements and acts of service as better indicators of value.</p>
