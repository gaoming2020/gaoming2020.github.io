          <p>Have you ever wondered why some films resonate deeply while others fall flat? It’s not always about plot or special effects – often, it’s about connection and representation. Recently, a conversation sparked by Denzel Washington’s remarks has reignited discussions about race within the film industry, particularly when analyzing ‘classic’ cinema. The focus isn’t solely on whether a movie is ‘good’ or ‘bad,’ but rather, <em>who</em> gets to tell stories and <em>whose</em> experiences are reflected on screen.</p>
<p>One key takeaway is the importance of cultural connection. Denzel, growing up, gravitated toward films like <em>Shaft</em> and <em>Superfly</em>, movies that reflected his world, in contrast to the works of Kubrick, a widely celebrated director. This isn’t to say Kubrick’s films lack merit, but it highlights how representation shapes our perception and engagement with art. As a young film buff, you are more likely to seek stories that mirror your own life. This isn’t about black or white, it’s about feeling understood.</p>
<p>It’s also essential to acknowledge that, historically, black filmmakers have had fewer opportunities. While the 70s saw the rise of blaxploitation films, it wasn’t until Spike Lee that consistent black voices began to break through again. The industry has changed; we’ve seen the success of movies like <em>Black Panther</em> and <em>Get Out</em>, and the rise of powerful figures like Oprah Winfrey. While opportunities are growing, the conversation about fair compensation for black actors and directors, particularly black women, is still vital. We need to move beyond just creating opportunities and aim for true equity in all aspects of the film industry.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the conversation around race in film should encourage us to broaden our horizons and recognize diverse perspectives. Let’s not focus on what is lacking, but instead on building an industry where all creators are valued and given the chance to share their unique stories. By embracing a wider range of stories, we enrich our cultural landscape and create films that truly speak to everyone. What films have profoundly impacted you and why?

          <p>Imagine losing your beloved pet in a car crash – a terrifying thought, right? Now, imagine that pet is a ball python named Peanut! This isn’t the plot of a quirky movie, but a real-life holiday story that unfolded on a snowy Michigan highway.  It all started with a multi-car accident on I-94, leaving Jessica, a college student, shaken and her emotional support animal, Peanut, missing in the wreckage.</p>
<p><strong>A Snake in Hiding</strong></p>
<p>Ball pythons are notorious for their hiding skills, and Peanut was no exception. After the crash, she vanished into the damaged car, leaving Jessica frantic.  First responders searched, but to no avail.  Enter Carly Kerns, a college student home for the holidays who worked for her family’s towing company.  Despite being afraid of snakes, Carly felt compelled to find Peanut.  She convinced her dad to bring the wrecked SUV into their heated garage.  Her dedication paid off when she spotted the snake under a car seat.  But, her fear got the best of her, so she called for help from her coworker, Will.</p>
<p><strong>From Wreckage to Recovery</strong></p>
<p>Will, no stranger to snakes (he played with garter snakes as a kid), wrangled Peanut from the wreckage, noticing that she wasn’t moving and seemed lifeless. The team sprang into action, using a heater to warm Peanut up.  Jessica was told the devastating news of Peanut’s apparent demise the next day. However, upon preparing to cremate Peanut, Jessica noticed a small movement, a sign of life.  A rush to the vet resulted in much-needed fluids and antibiotics.  Peanut is now back home, slowly recovering, thanks to the unlikely heroes at the towing company.</p>
<p><strong>More Than Just a Snake</strong></p>
<p>This story underscores the powerful bond between humans and their animal companions, even when that companion is a python. It also highlights the dedication of everyday people who go above and beyond. What started as a frightening car accident turned into a heartwarming tale of community, compassion, and a snake that defied all odds. It’s a powerful reminder that sometimes the most amazing stories unfold in the most unexpected places.</p>
<p>Have you ever had an unusual pet or a similar experience? Share your stories in the comments below, and let’s keep spreading the love and compassion this holiday season. And if you find yourself in a similar situation make sure you shout out to the tow truck drivers, they deal with a lot of things and they might be your best help!</p>

          <p>The fantasy football playoffs are here, and one wrong move can send your season spiraling. If you’re sweating over your Week 16 lineup, you’re not alone! This week is all about making the right calls to get you into that championship game.</p>
<p><strong>Quarterback Quandaries: Who to Ride and Who to Bench</strong></p>
<p>The QB landscape is volatile, with injuries and inconsistent performances making things tricky. One player you <em>shouldn’t</em> bench? <strong>Jayden Daniels.</strong> Despite a disappointing previous outing against the Eagles, he’s been a fantasy machine, averaging 27 points per game since then. The Eagles defense has actually allowed some solid QB performances, making Daniels a must-start with his rushing upside.</p>
<p>Another QB to consider is <strong>Bo Nix</strong>, who’s been on fire lately. Multiple passing touchdowns in four of his last five, and he’s facing a struggling Chargers defense that’s allowing tons of yards and touchdowns. Like Daniels, Nix offers dual-threat value, crucial for late-season fantasy success. Conversely, <strong>Brock Purdy</strong> is a firm sit this week. His recent form has been abysmal, with minimal fantasy points and a low TD rate. The Dolphins’ stingy defense against QBs further cements his bench status.</p>
<p><strong>Running Backs: The James Connor Show and Some Risky Business</strong></p>
<p>If you drafted or traded for <strong>James Connor</strong>, now is the time to rejoice! He was RB1 last week and faces the Panthers, who allow the most rushing yards and touchdowns to running backs in the league. This is a recipe for a dominant performance and potential league-winning production. On the other end of the spectrum, <strong>Isaiah Pacheco</strong> is looking shaky after his return. He’s splitting carries with Kareem Hunt and his explosiveness isn’t quite there. With the Chiefs O-line struggles and a tough matchup against the Texans, bench Pacheco this week. <strong>Najee Harris</strong> is another RB to steer clear of.  His production has drastically declined with Jalen Warren’s return and the Ravens’ league-best run defense poses a significant challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Sleeper Alert: A Dash of Cooper Rush and Rhamondre Stevenson</strong></p>
<p>Looking for some under-the-radar players to fill out your lineup? <strong>Cooper Rush</strong> has been quietly putting up numbers, racking up 8 touchdowns in the last four games. He’s facing the Buccaneers, who allow the second-most fantasy points to QBs. At running back, keep an eye on <strong>Rhamondre Stevenson</strong>. He might see an uptick in usage due to his matchup against the Bills, who are vulnerable against RBs. And don’t forget <strong>Mac Jones,</strong> who has quietly been a top-10 QB in two of his last 3 games, facing a porous Raiders secondary.</p>
<p><strong>Wide Receiver and Tight End Must-Starts and Sits: The Curious Case of Jonnu Smith</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> should be in your lineup. He’s been on fire, averaging 20 fantasy points per game, which is WR2 levels. Another receiver to consider is <strong>Ladd McConkey</strong>, who is showing real consistency with the slot snaps he is receiving and facing the 5th most Man coverage team. On the flip side, <strong>Amari Cooper’s</strong> volatility is alarming.  He can’t be trusted after a recent zero-catch performance. At tight end, the rise of <strong>Jonnu Smith</strong> is truly fascinating. He’s closer to TE2 than TE6, averaging over 20 fantasy points per game in his last 5.  Despite a tough matchup, he’s simply too good to sit. However, <strong>Travis Kelce</strong> is a risky sit this week with a noticeable dip in production. He’s not the dominant force of previous years. Consider options such as <strong>Brenton Strange</strong>, who saw a massive increase in volume last week. Another potential sleeper is <strong>Keenan Allen</strong>, who has been on a tear recently, and also consider <strong>Calvin Austin</strong> who has been getting the opportunities in the slot, against a vulnerable defense.</p>
<p>Week 16 is critical, so don’t let bad decisions ruin your playoff run. Do your research, trust your gut, and get ready for some high-stakes fantasy football!</p>

          <p>Get ready for a wild ride on the ice! The recent matchup between the Minnesota Wild and the Florida Panthers was anything but predictable, packed with goals, challenges, and enough drama to keep any hockey fan on the edge of their seat.  It wasn’t just a game; it was a masterclass in the highs and lows of NHL action. </p>
<p><strong>A Tale of Two Teams:</strong></p>
<p>The game started with Florida coming out strong, determined to pepper Wild goalie Marc-Andre Fleury with shots. They weren’t content with just any looks; they were focused on getting pucks low-to-high, creating chaos in front of the net. This high-pressure strategy paid off with a goal by Aaron Ekblad, a former number one overall draft pick, who beat Fleury with a clean wrist shot.  But Minnesota wasn’t going to roll over. They had to find consistency in their game, and they were definitely coming with a lot of intention to get pucks toward the net. </p>
<p><strong>The Drama Unfolds:</strong></p>
<p>The second key takeaway from this game was the intense back-and-forth of challenged calls and disallowed goals. A wild play saw a Minnesota goal by Marco Rossi overturned due to goalie interference, and it sparked debate. Then later in the game, a Florida goal was also challenged and disallowed because of an offside call during entry. These weren’t just minor calls either; they were game-changing moments that tested the nerves of players and fans alike, and really showed the importance of replay in the game. </p>
<p><strong>Florida Finds Their Groove:</strong> </p>
<p>Despite those challenges, Florida ultimately came out on top, led by a standout performance from their top line. They showcased their skill by exploiting tight spaces and finding room on rushes. One particular goal was a result of excellent play, demonstrating teamwork and finishing, putting the puck past Fleury. The Wild struggled to keep pace, especially with fatigue setting in from Kov’s shift, leading to Florida capitalizing on those opportunities.  Ultimately, it was a decisive win for Florida with a 5-1 final score. </p>
<p>So what can we learn? This game was a rollercoaster of momentum shifts, controversial calls, and high-level talent, but ultimately showed the importance of consistency and teamwork. The Panthers managed to capitalize on small errors and play a consistently strong offensive game. Are you excited to see where these teams go next? Let me know your thoughts in the comments and share this post with your fellow hockey fans!</p>

          <p>Imagine a city caught in a legal quagmire, facing a massive financial burden due to a years-long battle over a golf course. That’s the reality for one city as it inches closer to settling a dispute over the Badlands property. What started as a zoning disagreement has spiraled into a costly legal fight with a price tag potentially reaching hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown: the city council initially denied a developer’s plans to build residential housing on land that was previously zoned for that purpose. This decision ignited a legal firestorm when the developer sued, alleging the city illegally took the land. Court losses piled up, including a unanimous Nevada Supreme Court ruling against the city. The result? The city faced a risk of at least $450 million in further litigation costs, on top of the existing financial burden.</p>
<p>Now, after years of legal back-and-forth, a potential settlement is on the horizon, but it comes at a hefty price. Taxpayers are now facing an additional $286 million on top of existing costs.  The proposed settlement essentially puts the city back where it started, having to allow development on the land they tried so hard to prevent.  This raises the question: what was the point of the legal battle if the city ended up in the same place, but significantly poorer?</p>
<p> The city’s current leadership claims they are now working toward a resolution after the previous council’s decisions caused multiple losses.  The city manager also pointed out that it must weigh its duty to consider the quality of the project. This includes infrastructure concerns, police and fire support. The legacy of the previous city council’s actions now burdens taxpayers with hundreds of millions of dollars and leaves a stain on the city’s reputation. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the Badlands saga is a stark reminder of how crucial it is for city officials to make well-informed decisions that don’t lead to lengthy court battles that ultimately cost taxpayers. It’s also a great example of what happens when a city doesn’t think about the quality a project might bring, whether that’s for or against. Do you think the proposed settlement was worth the cost? Share your thoughts in the comments below, and consider sharing this post on social media to spread awareness about the impact of city decisions on taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Ever felt like the days are just dragging on during winter? Well, you’re not imagining things! We’re in the midst of the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, and it’s a pretty big deal in terms of weather and our seasonal perception. Here in Dallas-Fort Worth, it marks a shift, and it’s not just in the amount of daylight we get. Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>So, what exactly <em>is</em> the winter solstice? It’s the moment when the North Pole is tilted farthest away from the sun. This means the sun takes its lowest path across our sky, resulting in the fewest hours of daylight. For us in DFW, it’s the official start of winter, even if it may not feel like it every year. Beyond the science, it’s a great reminder that the cycle of seasons is constantly in motion, and brighter days are on their way (literally!). It’s a good time to embrace the coziness of the season, or even just give your house plants a little extra love.</p>
<p>But it’s not just about the darkness, is it? The video also hinted at a possible <em>rainy</em> Christmas. While a white Christmas in Texas is a rare fairytale, a rainy one is definitely more in the cards. What does this mean for our holiday plans? Well, maybe reconsider that outdoor gathering and pull out the board games and hot cocoa instead. Thinking about traffic? Get ready for potentially wet roads, so definitely drive carefully if you’re hitting the road to see loved ones. It’s a good idea to check local weather reports frequently to get the most updated information. And hey, maybe that rainy backdrop will make the cozy indoor setting even more festive!</p>
<p>Here’s the takeaway: the winter solstice is a fascinating astronomical event impacting us all, and even a rainy Christmas can have a certain charm to it. Don’t let the shortened daylight hours or potential rain get you down! Embrace the season, be prepared, and maybe even watch a festive movie to brighten the day. Want to know more about DFW weather?

          <p>Is Disney backing away from social issues? It seems like it. The upcoming Pixar series ‘Win or Lose,’ originally set to feature a transgender character with explicit dialogue about her identity, is now facing edits. Disney has chosen to remove specific lines, citing a desire to allow parents to introduce such topics to their children on their own terms. But is it that simple?</p>
<p>This move raises a lot of questions. Firstly, if the intention was always to give parents control, why were these conversations included in the first place? It’s worth noting that the character is still in the show, just without the direct references to her gender identity. One expert suggests that the decision may be influenced by current cultural wars and a perceived need for Disney to pull back from what some see as overly political messaging. It certainly seems to signal a shift in strategy.</p>
<p>Here’s the real issue: it appears to be an about-face from the studio. Disney, under previous leadership, has not shied away from LGBTQ+ content in the past, with projects like ‘Lightyear’ including same-sex relationships. So why this change now? Is Disney worried about backlash or are they truly aiming to create a space for parental guidance? The late timing of these script edits suggests something bigger was at play. It feels like the studio got cold feet when faced with the current social climate, leading them to make a last-minute pivot to more neutral grounds.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this situation highlights the complex dance between entertainment, social commentary, and parental responsibility. While Disney claims to be respectful of parents, the execution of these changes feels like it undermines their prior messaging, and it raises concerns about the company’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. What are your thoughts? Is it Disney’s job to tackle these topics or should that solely remain within the family setting?

          <p>When a loved one vanishes, the silence is deafening. That’s the reality for the family of Jenny Bryan, a Cornell University graduate who has been missing since October 16th. Her sister, Jacque, recently spoke out, expressing frustration and urgency about the lack of attention this case has received. It’s a story that deserves to be heard, and here’s why.</p>
<p><strong>A Troubling Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Jenny’s case is not a simple matter of someone choosing to disappear. According to Jacque, Jenny had previously expressed fears about something happening to her. She had lost touch with close contacts, a marked departure from her usual active social media presence. Although a wellness check in April found her safe, an email to her ex-boyfriend in August about moving to a new city and a strange follow-up email in late October mentioning a potential marriage and job offer, suggest a very erratic state of mind. These actions, alongside her sudden complete social media silence, raise serious red flags.</p>
<p><em>Key Point 1: Disappearance Uncharacteristic: This is not the story of someone who simply wanted to start fresh. Jacque insists that Jenny, a recent Cornell graduate with a podcast and ambitions, would never abandon her digital footprint entirely.</em> </p>
<p><strong>Missed Opportunities and Frustration</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most infuriating aspects of this case is the perceived lack of action. Jacque has taken it upon herself to piece together a timeline, finding witnesses who have seen Jenny in the LA area. She’s even identified CCTV footage that could hold vital clues. However, the response from law enforcement has been slow. One example of the frustration was the inability of the detectives to review camera footage due to the lack of a specific time and clothing description. These barriers, while understandable, feel particularly disheartening to those desperately seeking answers.</p>
<p><em>Key Point 2: Potential Leads Ignored: The reluctance of the detectives to pursue known CCTV footage when the manager of the store was willing to cooperate is a key factor in the growing frustration. This lack of proactivity is potentially delaying resolution of the case.</em></p>
<p><strong>A Call for Awareness</strong></p>
<p>The frustrating reality is this: some missing persons cases get more media coverage than others. The case of Hana Kobayashi, a Hawaiian woman who wasn’t even missing, became a national story. Jenny’s disappearance, however, has not garnered the same attention. Jacque’s message is clear: her sister’s case deserves the same level of investigation and public awareness. There was also the added concern that Jenny was staying with someone who her sister believes could be a danger to her. </p>
<p><em>Key Point 3: Disparity in Media Coverage: The fact that Jenny’s case is not receiving the same attention as other missing person cases is not only unfair but also potentially hinders the investigation.</em> </p>
<p>Jenny Bryan’s disappearance is a chilling reminder that behind every missing person case is a family desperately searching for answers. If you have any information, please don’t hesitate to contact the authorities. This case deserves our attention, and Jenny deserves to be found. Let’s share this and bring Jenny home. #JennyBryan #MissingPerson #CornellUniversity #LosAngeles #HelpFindJenny</p>

          <p>Have you ever wondered why your prescription costs seem so unpredictable? Or why your local, independent pharmacy suddenly closed its doors? You’re not alone. A concerning trend is sweeping across Minnesota and potentially the nation: the rise of ‘pharmacy deserts’ – areas where access to local pharmacies is severely limited, forcing people to travel long distances or rely on mail-order services. But what’s causing this, and are powerful pharmacy middlemen to blame?</p>
<p><strong>The Middlemen Problem: Who Are PBMs?</strong><br>Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) are the companies that negotiate drug prices between drug manufacturers, insurance companies, and pharmacies. Initially meant to help keep consumer costs down, these PBMs have become increasingly powerful. Today, three major companies – Optum, CVS Caremark, and Express Scripts – control a staggering 80% of all prescriptions filled in the United States.  Here’s the twist: these same PBMs are often part of large healthcare corporations that also own their own pharmacies. Is this a conflict of interest? It certainly looks like it, and critics are claiming it allows these PBMs to prioritize their own pharmacies while squeezing out independent pharmacies.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Pharmacies on the Brink</strong><br>Independent pharmacies, like the ones run by Deb Keaveney and Deborah Lidl, are struggling to stay afloat. These pharmacies claim that PBMs are reimbursing them at rates that don’t even cover the wholesale cost of some medications. For example, one receipt showed a pharmacy losing money selling a common diabetes medication. This forces patients to travel further, often having to use large chain pharmacies owned by the very entities putting the independents out of business. The result is the creation of these pharmacy deserts, leaving communities without readily accessible, personal, and trusted healthcare providers.</p>
<p><strong>The Fight for Transparency</strong><br>The good news is that this issue isn’t going unnoticed. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating PBMs, noting that these “powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing main street pharmacies”.  There is a bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate designed to add much-needed transparency to PBM practices. Minnesota, too, has made attempts to tackle the issue, penalizing PBMs for pushing customers to their own pharmacies. However,  these powerful middlemen continue to claim their focus is on reducing costs for consumers, despite evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>Your Takeaway</strong><br>The fight for fair drug prices and accessible pharmacies is far from over. We need transparency and accountability from PBMs to ensure that independent pharmacies can thrive and that patients have easy access to their medications without having to drive 20 plus miles. Don’t hesitate to voice your concerns to your local representatives.  Share this article and help raise awareness about the impact of PBMs on your communities. Let’s demand better healthcare for everyone.</p>

          <p>Is the system failing our youth? That’s the question many are asking in Washington State, where juvenile detention facilities are facing a crisis of overcrowding and scandal. The situation at Green Hill, the state’s detention center for older inmates, has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons, from staff misconduct to rampant drug use and violence. Now, the state is scrambling to find solutions, and their latest move is sparking debate. </p>
<p>The crux of the issue is a stark mismatch between the number of inmates and the facility’s capacity. Green Hill is designed for 180 inmates, but as of recently, it housed a staggering 239 young men. This extreme overcrowding isn’t just a matter of numbers; it’s creating a breeding ground for problems. The result?  A concerning rise in drug overdoses, fights, and even inappropriate relationships between staff and inmates. The state has tried to implement new protocols, but their efforts seem to be outpaced by the overwhelming challenges of an overpopulated facility. It paints a disturbing picture of a system stretched far beyond its limits. </p>
<p>So, what’s the answer? The state is now opening a new unit within an adult correctional facility, Stafford Creek. This move, a repurposing of vacant space, is intended to alleviate the overcrowding at Green Hill, adding 48 new beds. While this provides a short-term solution, the fact that it had to resort to using an adult facility for juvenile offenders speaks volumes about the severity of the situation. This move also comes after the department was taken to court for trying to send juvenile inmates to adult prisons, a policy they had to reverse. The state’s actions highlight the challenges in balancing safety and the welfare of these young people. </p>
<p>What does the future hold for Washington’s juvenile justice system?  With a new director for the Department of Children, Youth, and Families, the agency responsible for juvenile facilities, there is hope for a fresh approach to fixing these systemic problems. However, it remains clear that a much bigger, comprehensive approach is needed. The problem isn’t simply solved with new beds; it requires addressing the root causes of juvenile delinquency, implementing effective prevention programs, and promoting rehabilitation. This is a system in desperate need of reform, and the new solution is nothing more than a band-aid on a much deeper wound. What do you think? Share your thoughts in the comments below and let’s discuss the future of juvenile justice. </p>
